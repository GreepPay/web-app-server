# Web App Server

A simple Node.js service to serve and manage SEO for Single Page Applications (SPAs).

## Description

This server is designed to address the SEO challenges often encountered when building SPAs.  It provides a basic framework for:

*   Serving static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
*   Implementing server-side rendering (SSR) or pre-rendering to make SPAs more crawlable by search engines.
*   Managing routes and redirects for SEO purposes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd web-app-server
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Usage

1.  Configure the server (e.g., routes, static asset directory) in `config.js` or similar.

2.  Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Or, for development with hot reloading:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:<port>` (default port is usually 8080).

## Configuration

The server's behavior can be configured through a configuration file (e.g., `config.js`).  Typical configuration options include:

*   `port`: The port the server listens on.
*   `staticDir`: The directory containing static assets.
*   `routes`:  A mapping of routes to handlers (e.g., for SSR or redirects).
